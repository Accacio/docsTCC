\chapter{Control Logic}
\label{cha:control}
A \CIPN{} can be used to
represent the control of the system, and then this Petri net can be converted
into a \LD, with the aim of being implemented in a \PLC. So, this chapter will be
divided in two parts: the first part to describe the logic of the control and
its design using \CIPN, and the second part for the implementation in the \PLC.
\section{Control Interpreted Petri net for the manufacturing system}
\label{sec:logic}
The logic of the control is to use the 6 units presented in
\Autoref{cha:system}, to assemble cubes made of a plastic half cube on top of a
metallic half cube. Once the cube is assembled, it is stored in one of
the store spaces of the \verb|Storage Unit|. 
The logic is divided in 10 modules:
 Initialization, Metal Cube half sorting, Plastic Cube half sorting, Arm From
 Conveyor Belt to Assembly Unit, Assembly Unit, Arm From Assembly Unit to
 Storage Unit, Storage Unit positioning (y-axis), Storage Unit positioning (x-axis), Cube Storage and Arm Stop Logic.

Each module will be briefly described in the next subsections, and their Petri
Nets will be presented along with tables that describe the meaning of each place
and transition.

\begin{observation}
  Each Petri net shown in this chapter is a part of a complete Petri net.
 The complete one is presented in \Autoref{cha:CompletePetriNet}. The dotted
  places\slash transitions represent places\slash transitions that belong to
  other parts of the complete Petri net.
%   In the
% digital form of this work, it is possible to travel between figures by clicking
% the name of the dotted places\slash transitions. By clicking in normal
% places\slash transitions it is possible to travel between the figure and its
% corresponding entry in the table that describes its meaning.
\end{observation}
\subsection{Initialization}
This module has as objective to make sure that all units are in order to begin
the assembling process, that means, all variables used are reset, the arm is
calibrated, the conveyor belt is free of pieces, all cylinders are retracted,
the assembly unit is ready to receive a piece and the storage unit is in its
rightmost and lower position. The Petri net used for this module can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriInitialization} and the corresponding meaning of its
transitions and places can be seen in \Autoref{tab:initialTransitions,tab:initialPlaces}

{petriInitialization}
\subsection{Metal Cube Half Sorting}
This module serves to sort the cube halves stacked in MAG 1. The piece is
extracted from the bottom of the stack to the conveyor belt, and the piece is
transported by the belt to the identification part of the sorting unit. If it is
a metallic
piece with an upwards concavity the piece continues in the belt until it
reaches the end of the belt, waiting to be picked by the arm. Otherwise, the piece is
discarded using the sorting unit and the cycle recommences and stops only when
a metallic piece is at the end of the belt.
In order to recognize the orientation of the pieces (upwards or downwards), the
distance sensor is combined with comparison blocks to create two variables
\verb|ConcUP| and \verb|ConcDWN|.
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriMetal} and \Autoref{tab:metalvTransitions,tab:metalvPlaces}.

\subsection{Plastic Cube Half Sorting}
This module is similar to its metallic counterpart. This module sorts the cube
halves stacked in Mag 2. Instead of metal pieces with upwards concavity, this
module accepts white plastic pieces with downwards concavity.
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriPlastic} and \Autoref{tab:plasticTransitions,tab:plasticPlaces}.

\addtikzfigureLandscape{../../figures/petriNet/partial/plastic}
{Petri net of plastic cube half sorting module.}
{petriPlastic}

\subsection{Arm From Conveyor Belt to Assembly Unit}
This module uses the manipulator to remove a piece from the end of the
conveyor belt and place it in the assembly holder of the Assembly Unit. It places
a metal piece
and then a plastic piece, so they can be assembled to form a cube using the press.
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriArmBeltToPress} and \Autoref{tab:armBeltToPressTransitions,tab:armBeltToPressPlaces}.

\addtikzfigureLandscape{../../figures/petriNet/partial/armBeltToPress}
{Petri net of manipulator taking a cube half from conveyor belt to assembly unit
  module.}
{petriArmBeltToPress}
\subsection{Assembly Unit}
This module serves to press the two pieces, mounting a cube. Once both pieces
are placed in the Assembly Unit Holder, it is retracted, the safety door is
closed and the press is lowered, forming the cube. Then the press is raised, the
door is opened, and the holder extended, waiting for the cube to be removed by
the manipulator.
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriPress} and \Autoref{tab:pressTransitions,tab:pressPlaces}.

\addtikzfigureLandscape{../../figures/petriNet/partial/press}
{Petri net of assembly unit module.}
{petriPress}
\subsection{Arm From Assembly Unit To Storage Unit}
This module uses the arm to move the cube from the Assembly Unit Holder
to the storage device of the Storage Unit. An additional encoder similar to 
\texttt{Storage Unit Horizontal Encoder} was placed just beside this same encoder.
In order to
help the alignment of the arm with the Storage Device. This new encoder is called 
\texttt{Storage Unit Arm Alignment Encoder}, and is presented in the logic of this module.
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriPress} and \Autoref{tab:armPressToStorageTransitions,tab:armPressToStoragePlaces}.

{petriarmPressToStorage}
\subsection{Storage Unit Positioning (y Axis)}
This module sets the vertical position of the Storage Device. Once the cube is
in the Storage Device, it is raised until the device is vertically aligned with the
corresponding store space. The order of storage in the rack is from top to
bottom, right to left.  
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriStorageY} and \Autoref{tab:storageYTransitions,tab:storageYPlaces}.

{petriStorageY}
\subsection{Storage Unit Positioning (x Axis)}
This module sets the horizontal position of the Storage Device. This module and
the last module occurs simultaneously. Instead of raising the Storage Device, this
module makes it move from right to left until it is horizontally aligned with the
corresponding store space.  
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriStorageX} and \Autoref{tab:storageXTransitions,tab:storageXPlaces}.

{petriStorageX}
\subsection{Cube Storage}
This module has the objective of storing the cube in the correct space with which the
storage device is vertically and horizontally aligned. 
The corresponding Petri net and tables can be seen in
\Autoref{fig:petriStorePiece} and \Autoref{tab:storePieceTransitions,tab:storePiecePlaces}.

{petriStorePiece}
\subsection{Arm Stop Logic}
Since the arm is controlled by \emph{single acting pneumatic cylinders}, if in any
moment the inputs of these cylinders is turned off voluntarily or not, they are
going to retract, which can damage the arm. So, in order to prevent these
kinds of
accidents this module was created.
This module creates different behaviours for the turning off of the arm
depending on the angle it is. 
Each behaviour turns the arm to a safe position before retracting the cylinders.
% With aim of stopping
% the system and consequentially the arm in any part of the process, a virtual button was created
% in the implementation phase.
A transition is created from every
place in all other modules to the first place in this module. This transition
corresponds to the will of stopping the system and consequently the arm. For organisation's
sake all those transitions are represented in the Petri net as the transition $t_{156}$.

Some angles were chosen to divide the areas where the arm can be, and the
rotation logic is different for each one of them. These angles can be seen in \Autoref{fig:armStopLogicAngles}.

\section{Implementation of the Control}
\label{sec:implementation}
The implementation of the control in this work is carried out using \PLCs{}. The units shown in \Autoref{cha:system} are
divided in two groups. Each group is connected to a Siemens \PLC{} S7-1500, as
the one shown in \Autoref{fig:plc}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,clip,trim={25cm 12cm 15cm 10cm}]{maquete/plc.jpg} 
  \caption{Siemens \PLC{} S7-1500}
  \label{fig:plc}
\end{figure}

The first \PLC{} is connected with both magazines,the conveyor belt and the
sorting unit. As those units are used to select the kind of pieces, this \PLC{}
is identified as Selection. In order to program the Ladder logic it is needed to
create tags to represent every input and output. In
\Autoref{tab:plcSelectionInput,tab:plcSelectionOutput} we can see the
correspondence between the name of the input\slash output, the address in which
it is connected and the name of the tag created to represent it in the Ladder
Logic.

\input{../../tables/nomenclature/plc1}
The \verb|Distance Sensor| outputs an integer
so the variables \verb|ConcUP| and \verb|ConcDWN| were created using the
following comparisons:
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:concUpconcDown}
    % \verb|ConcUP|=2
    \text{\tt ConcUP} &=\text{\tt Distance Sensor} \geq 1000 \text{ \& } \text{\tt Distance Sensor} < 10000 \\
    \text{\tt ConcDWN}&=\text{\tt Distance Sensor} \geq 10000
  \end{align}

The other units (Handling Unit, Assembly Unit and Storage Unit) are connected to
the second \PLC, identified as Handling-Assembly-Storage. 
\Autoref{tab:plcHandlingInput,tab:plcHandlingOutput} identify the addresses and
tags for this \PLC.  
 
\input{../../tables/nomenclature/plc2}

To convert the \CIPN{} from \Autoref{sec:logic} into \LD{} the method
presented in \Autoref{sec:cipnToLD} was used. And in order to implement the connection
between the two \PLCs{} the method shown in \Autoref{sec:multiplePlcs} was used.
In order to configure the ``Get'' and ``Put'' blocks and consequently the
connection between the two \PLCs, the tutorials shown in
section 3.4 of \cite{rochapereira2019automacao} was used.

For
brevity's sake the ladder logic was concealed, but can easily be
found at the following link
\url{https://github.com/Accacio/docsTCC/tree/master/PLC/TCC}, where all files of the TIA
Project used in this work is stored.
